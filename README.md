# SchoolSchedule

It is a prototype application to maintain and update school class schedule. The data can be submitted to the server, which stores it and returns back the same when we submit a query.

It has been built using JSP and servlet. The servlet acts as a controller to handle the requests. Web page is created using JSP which contains a table to input the class schedule which is then directed to the server which is the local host for processing.
